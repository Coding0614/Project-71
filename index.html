                    <p class="text-muted text-left"> Lakeside Middle School was established and opened during 2009, but it has changed a lot since then. Lakeside has a band, gym, and rooms for academics and lunch too. I am very excited to go there because middle school is completely different from elementary school. One of my favorite places in there is the Enrichment room, which is where us students read books. This room is a quiet place to read and ask the teacher about books that are at your level. I love reading, and for me, this room is the perfect place for me to drop everything and read. So, I think that Lakeside Middle School is a very good and interesting school. </p>

                    <p> English Language Arts, or ELA, is a subject that includes Reading, Writing, Word Recognition, and many other sections. In 6th grade, you learn how to define and comprehend words at 6th grade level. You also expand on standards from the previous grade, like inferencing and types of figurative language. You will also keep learning and understanding Poetry and Drama. In this grade, you will finally be able to differentiate between a central idea and a main idea. And finally, you will start to write even more complicated essays and do more opinion papers. I think learning this is very important because these standards will improve your knowledge on the English language. </p>

                    <p> Sixth grade Mathematics is super cool and it will be very fun to learn all the standards. This grade's Mathematics has a lot of new sections since the previous grades, like Number Sense, Statistics and Probability, Ratios and Proportional Relationships, Expressions and Equations, and Geometry. We also expand on a lot of old standards like multiplying/dividing fractions and multiplying/dividing decimals. 6th graders also should know how to calculate the area of parallelograms and rhombi. A lot of kids love math and what knowledge they get from it, like me, but for the kids that don't like math, just give it a try. I am sure you will make it through these units. There are a lot of things to learn in math, so be ready, and have fun learning these units and standards! </p>

                    <p> Science for middle schoolers is super interesting and it expands on your knowledge from elementary school. In 6th grade, you will learn about sections of science like Physical Science, Earth Science, and Life Science. You will also learn about weather, climate, geology, and human impacts on animals and other organisms. In 7th grade, you will keep expanding on sixth grade standards and you will also learn the science of evolution, genetics, and chemistry. Finally, in eighth grade, you will branch out to topics like astronomy, waves, and forces. Even though these standards might sound hard and mind-boggling, these things are fun to learn. If you learn these standards, your future science lessons will become easier. So, put all your efforts in science, and your efforts will be proven worthy in life. </p>

Students are encouraged to put their best work into these robots and work with others too. Some things to consider are that only students can work on these VEX robots, not parents or anyone else, and the meeting time for this club is on Fridays, during Flex time. Later on in the year, competitions are held at Alliance Academy and students can compete to qualify for State and National competitions too. Have fun and enjoy the year as a robotics kid!!  </p>
